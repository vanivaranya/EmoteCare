## Problem Statement

Many individuals hesitate to seek therapy due to societal taboos and fear of judgment, while personalized one-on-one therapy sessions are often inaccessible and financially burdensome. This leads to prolonged suffering, a lower quality of life, with depression and suicide in extreme cases.

## Tech Stack

### AI/ML
*Framework:* TensorFlow; *Model:* CNN 
Worked on CNN and VGG16 models. Combined two datasets. While the CNN model offers much better accuracy, VGG16 gives a simpler architecture with fewer trainable parameters. But we proceeded with CNN as we focus more on the accuracy.

### Frontend 
HTML, CSS, Javascript 

### Backend
Flask, SQLite, OpenCV

## Future Scope

**Improving accuracy and architecture:** WIll be improving the efficiency of the model by training it on the data gradually received from the users.


**Community Engagement:** Partnering with advocacy groups and organizations to reduce mental health stigma and promote awareness of online therapy options.
